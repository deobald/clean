** Icon Designs

We have come up with two styles for the icons.  Both styles are
tentative and can be modified as you choose.  We have down played the
details on shaded versions a bit since we were uncertain which style
would suit better.  Please have a look and let us know what your thoughts
are.

*** Style 1

Minimalistic details.
Just enough strokes to convey the details.

Coloured version has plain colours.

*** Style 2


Thick strokes define the outer shape. Thinner lines and dither pattern used for inner details.

Coloured versions are rendered as stickers.

*** Style 3

Gradients as fill and thick outer strokes used to define the shape. Anthropomorphised for a cute look.
